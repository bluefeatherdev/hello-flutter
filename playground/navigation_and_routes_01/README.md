# navigation_and_routes_01

This Flutter playground app demonstrates basic navigation and route management using `MaterialApp` with named routes. The application starts on an `Intro Page` that contains a button to navigate to the `Home Page` using `Navigator.pushNamed()`. It highlights how to configure routes in the `MaterialApp` widget, define multiple pages (`StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`), and switch between them with simple navigation logic. This example introduces the fundamentals of routing and page transitions in Flutter.
