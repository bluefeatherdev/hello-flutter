# navigation_and_routes_02

This Flutter playground app expands on basic navigation by introducing multiple named routes and pages. The application starts on an Intro Page that provides buttons to navigate to either the Home Page or the Contact Page using `Navigator.pushNamed()`. Each page is styled with its own text and color theme, while a consistent footer message is displayed across all screens. The example highlights how to configure multiple routes in `MaterialApp`, manage navigation between them, and maintain a cohesive UI structure with `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `BottomNavigationBar` elements. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of multi-page navigation and route organization in Flutter.
