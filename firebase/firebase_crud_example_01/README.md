# firebase_crud_example_01

This Flutter project demonstrates how to integrate **Firebase Firestore** into a Flutter app to perform basic **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
It includes Firebase initialization, a service layer for Firestore, and a simple UI to manage notes.

## Structure

- **main.dart**
  - Initializes Firebase with `Firebase.initializeApp()` using platform-specific options from `firebase_options.dart`.
  
  - Runs the root widget `MainApp`, which sets `HomePage` as the entry point.

- **firebase_options.dart**
  - File generated by the FlutterFire CLI.
  
  - Contains the `DefaultFirebaseOptions` class with platform-specific Firebase configuration.

- **services/firestore_service.dart**
  - Encapsulates Firestore logic in a dedicated service class.
  
  - Provides methods for:
  
    - **addNote** → Create a new note with a timestamp.
    
    - **getNotesStream** → Read notes as a real-time stream ordered by timestamp.
    - **updateNote** → Update an existing note by document ID.
    - **deleteNote** → Delete a note by document ID.

- **pages/home_page.dart**
  - UI layer that consumes `FirestoreService`.
  
  - Uses a `StreamBuilder` to listen to the notes collection in real time.
  - Displays notes in a `ListView` with options to edit or delete.
  - Provides a floating action button to add new notes via a dialog box.

## Key Points

- **Firebase Core** is required to initialize Firebase in Flutter.

- **Cloud Firestore** is used as the database for storing and managing notes.
- **StreamBuilder** allows real-time updates from Firestore to be reflected in the UI.
- **FirestoreService** abstracts database logic, keeping the UI clean and focused.
- This example is a solid starting point for building **Firebase-powered apps** with CRUD functionality.

## Example Workflow

1. Tap the **+ FloatingActionButton** to add a new note.

2. Notes are displayed in a list, ordered by timestamp.
3. Use the **edit icon** to update an existing note.
4. Use the **delete icon** to remove a note from Firestore.
