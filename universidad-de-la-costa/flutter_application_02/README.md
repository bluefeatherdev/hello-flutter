# flutter_application_02

This simple Flutter app demonstrates basic UI structure and interactivity. It features a home screen with an `AppBar` titled 'Home App Example' and a centered `ElevatedButton`. The button responds to short and long presses by printing messages to the console. The app showcases core Flutter widgets including `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `ElevatedButton`, along with custom text styling.
