# flutter_application_01

This introductory Flutter app demonstrates the basic structure of a mobile application using core widgets. It displays a home screen with an `AppBar` titled "My First Flutter App" and a centered text widget styled with custom font size and color, showing the message "Hello World!". The example highlights the use of `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Center`, and `Text` as foundational building blocks for creating user interfaces in Flutter.
