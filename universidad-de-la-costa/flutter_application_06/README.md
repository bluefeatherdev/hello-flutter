# flutter_application_06

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of `CheckboxListTile` widgets to create a list of selectable options with supporting text. Each tile includes a title, subtitle, and a checkbox that updates its state using `setState()`. The example showcases how to manage multiple boolean values, control layout behavior with `isThreeLine`, and visually separate items using `Divider`. It highlights the flexibility of `CheckboxListTile` for building clean, interactive forms or preference screens.
