# flutter_application_05

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of `RadioListTile` widgets to create a gender selection interface. It uses an `enum` (`Genders`) to define selectable options and a `StatefulWidget` to manage the selected value. The app showcases how to group radio buttons using `RadioGroup`, update state with `setState()`, and handle user interaction through a button that prints the selected gender to the console. This example highlights clean UI composition with `Column`, `Center`, and styled `ElevatedButton`.
