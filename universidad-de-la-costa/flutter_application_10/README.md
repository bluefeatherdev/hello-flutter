# flutter_application_10

This Flutter application demonstrates the use of forms, text controllers, and state management to calculate an employee’s total wage based on the number of hours worked and the hourly rate. The app includes:

- Input fields for employee name, hours worked, and hourly rate.

- A calculation function that multiplies hours by the hourly rate to display the total wage.

- A personalized developer signature with a clickable GitHub link using `url_launcher`.

- A clean UI with `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `BottomNavigationBar` components.

This project highlights practical Flutter concepts such as widget composition, stateful logic, input handling, and external package integration.
