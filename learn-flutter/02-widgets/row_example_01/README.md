# row_example_01

This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the `Row` widget to arrange multiple children horizontally. The example showcases how `Expanded` widgets distribute available space evenly among children, ensuring proper alignment and responsiveness.

- A `Row` with three children: two `Text` widgets and a `FlutterLogo`.

- Use of `Expanded` to make each child occupy equal horizontal space.

- Centered text alignment for consistent layout.

- A `FittedBox` wrapping the `FlutterLogo` to ensure it scales properly within its allocated space.

This project highlights the fundamentals of Flutter’s layout system, focusing on horizontal alignment and flexible sizing with `Row` and `Expanded`.
