# sliverappbar_example_02

This Flutter application demonstrates the use of a `SliverAppBar` with the `stretch` property enabled. The app showcases how the app bar can expand beyond its normal height when the user overscrolls, creating a stretch effect.

- A `SliverAppBar` configured with `stretch`, `stretchTriggerOffset`, and `onStretchTrigger`.

- A `FlexibleSpaceBar` with a title and a `FlutterLogo` as the background.

- A scrollable `SliverList` with alternating background colors for visual clarity.

- A bottom navigation bar with a `Switch` to enable or disable the stretch behavior dynamically.

- Use of `BouncingScrollPhysics` to enhance the overscroll effect.

This project highlights advanced customization of Flutter’s sliver widgets, focusing on interactive scrolling behaviors and user-triggered stretch effects
