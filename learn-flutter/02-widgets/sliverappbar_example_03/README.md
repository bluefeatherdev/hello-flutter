# sliverappbar_example_03

This Flutter application demonstrates the interactive behavior of a `SliverAppBar` using the `pinned`, `floating`, and `snap` properties. The app allows users to toggle these options at runtime and observe how the app bar responds while scrolling.

- A `SliverAppBar` with configurable `pinned`, `floating`, and `snap` properties.

- A `FlexibleSpaceBar` with a title and a `FlutterLogo` as the background.

- A `SliverToBoxAdapter` with instructional text.

- A scrollable SliverList with alternating background colors for clarity.

- A bottom navigation bar with switches to dynamically enable or disable each property.

This project highlights the flexibility of Flutter’s sliver system and provides a hands-on way to explore different app bar behaviors in scrollable layouts
