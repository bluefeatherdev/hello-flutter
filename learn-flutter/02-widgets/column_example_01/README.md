# column_example_01

This Flutter application demonstrates the use of the `Column` widget to arrange multiple children vertically. It highlights how `Text` widgets and an `Expanded` widget containing a `FittedBox` with a `FlutterLogo` can be combined to create a responsive vertical layout.

- A `Column` with three children: two `Text` widgets and an `Expanded` widget wrapping a `FittedBox` with a `FlutterLogo`.

- The `Expanded` widget ensures that the `FlutterLogo` takes up the remaining vertical space, while the `FittedBox` scales it properly within its constraints.

- The `AppBar` provides a title, and the `Scaffold` organizes the overall structure of the app.

- The layout is centered using the `Center` widget, ensuring the `Column` is placed in the middle of the screen.

This project highlights the fundamentals of vertical layout in Flutter using the `Column` widget, combined with `Expanded` and `FittedBox` for responsive design.
