# sliverappbar_example_01

This Flutter application demonstrates the use of a `SliverAppBar` within a `CustomScrollView`. The app showcases how an app bar can expand, collapse, and remain pinned while scrolling through content.

- A `SliverAppBar` with expandedHeight, pinned, and `flexibleSpace` configurations.

- An action button (`+`) in the app bar that triggers a `SnackBar` for debugging.

- A scrollable `SliverList` with multiple items to visualize the collapsing behavior.

- Clean Material Design styling with a teal theme.

This project highlights the flexibility of Flutter’s sliver widgets and their integration with scrollable layouts.
