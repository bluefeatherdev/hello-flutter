# flutter_application_03

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of a `StatefulWidget` to manage dynamic data. The application displays a counter on the home screen, which updates each time the user presses the 'Increment counter' button. It highlights the use of `setState()` for state management, along with core widgets such as `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Text`, and `ElevatedButton`. This example introduces the fundamentals of interactivity and reactive UI updates in Flutter.
