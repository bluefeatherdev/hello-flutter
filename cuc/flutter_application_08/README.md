# flutter_application_08

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of the `Container` widget for layout, styling, and decoration. The example builds a simple screen with an `AppBar` titled "Container App Example" and a `Container` that spans the device width, has fixed height, margin, and padding. The container is styled with a teal background, rounded corners, and contains a centered text message "Hello, Flutter!" with custom font size and color. This example highlights how `Container` can combine layout, spacing, and visual design in Flutter.
