# flutter_application_09

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of the `ListView` widget to create a scrollable list of items. The example builds a simple screen with an `AppBar` titled "ListView App Example" and a vertical list containing three colored containers labeled Entry A, Entry B, and Entry C. Each container has a fixed height, background color, and centered text. This example highlights how `ListView` can efficiently arrange multiple widgets in a scrollable layout with padding and consistent styling.
