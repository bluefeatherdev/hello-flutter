# flutter_application_04

This Flutter app demonstrates user input handling and dynamic calculations with a `StatefulWidget`. The application allows users to enter the number of units and the price per unit through text fields, then calculates the total payment when the "Get Payment" button is pressed. It highlights the use of `TextEditingController`, `double`.`tryParse` for safe numeric parsing, and `setState()` for reactive UI updates. The layout also showcases how to constrain widget width and manage spacing within a `Column`.
