# flutter_application_07

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of the `DropdownButton` widget to create a simple selection menu. The application initializes with a default value and allows users to choose from a list of options (One, Two, Three, Four). It highlights how to manage state with `setState()`, customize the dropdown’s appearance with icons, text styles, and underline decoration, and dynamically build menu items from a list. This example introduces interactive selection controls and reactive UI updates in Flutter.
